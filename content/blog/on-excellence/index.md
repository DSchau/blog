_Note: this post is a work-in-progress. If you're reading this, kudos! I have a super fan. I'll update it with more examples on a rolling basis as I find them. Excellence is hard!_

Excellence is a concept that is often talked about, frequently claimed, and rare. Some examples of products, ideas, and concrete examples of excellence on display and what makes them excellent:

- [**rsync, command-line utility for syncing files**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync). `rsync` is a prototypical example of a utility that _just works_ every time, consistently, without fail. It does its core job completely: syncing files from a source to a destination consistently.
- [**Uni-ball Kuru Toga, Mechanical Pencil**](https://uniballco.com/products/kuru-toga-mechanical-pencils). The best pencil I've ever used. The lead rotates subtly and slightly as you write, which keeps the lead sharp and your lines crisp and clean.
  - _Note: I'm kind of a pen/pencil nerd, check out [Jet Pens](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Uni-Kuru-Toga-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/706) for some even nicer iterations of the Kuru Toga pencil_
- [**Nonstick pan, Made-in**](https://madeincookware.com/products/non-stick-frying-pan/10-inch-graphite). I've used countless iterations of "non-stick" pans and they all suffer from a singular fatal flaw: notably, that they _all_ begin to stick after a period of 3-6 months. After 1-year plus, still highly non-stick.
