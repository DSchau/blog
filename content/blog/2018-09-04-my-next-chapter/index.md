![My next chapter](./images/my-next-chapter.jpg)

_(Pretend that's me and not Kevin Durant)_

I'm incredibly excited to announce that I've accepted a role with Gatsby Inc. working on an awesome static-site generator for React--although anyone who follows me on Twitter knows I think it's so much more ðŸ˜….

For those who may not be aware of what Gatsby is, go check out [the documentation](https://gatsbyjs.org) and read up on the [company itself](https://gatsbyjs.com) if it tickles your fancy--oh, and this blog you're reading right now? Created with and powered by Gatsby! Gatsby powers an increasing number of incredibly successful and performant websites, including [the ReactJS.org docs](https://reactjs.org), [CSS Grid by Mozilla](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/), and [far, far more][site-showcase].

The role with Gatsby will be far different than anything I've done as of yet in my career, but I look very much forward to this next journey working on something that I believe to be transformative, powerful, and capable of shaping the modern web experience.

## Thank you

I want to thank each and every one of my co-workers (and friends!) not only at Object Partners, but also Union Pacific. Both were transformative places in my career, and I can't recommend them both highly enough. Talented folks working on fun projects, what more could you want!?
