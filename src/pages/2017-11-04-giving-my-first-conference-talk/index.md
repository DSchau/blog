I recently spoke at ThunderPlains in Oklahoma City. It was an incredible experience, and it also happend to be my very first (of hopefully many!) conference talks. I learned a lot in giving this talk, I met a bunch of incredible people, and I'm incredibly indebted to the organizers of the conference for giving me this opportunity. In the same spirit of "giving an opportunity," I would imagine that there are others, like me, who would love to give a conference talk and share their experiences, so towards that end, I'll attempt to collect and share what I've learned throughout the process of giving this first talk. I'll attempt to illustrate each part of the process, including creating the CFP (Call for Proposal), creating the slide deck, and then tips for actually giving your first conference talk.

# Call for Proposals and Rejection

Many have noted this, but it is reasonably unlikely that the first conference you apply for will accept your first proposal. In fact, some of the most accomplished speakers note about a 1 in 10 success rate for submitting a proposal that is accepted.

With this in mind, the overarching principle you must keep in your head is&hellip; next time it'll work out! Don't get too down if a particular conference you were especially excited for doesn't work out. The conference scene is so incredibly varied, vibrant, and _vast_ that there will be a conference that accepts you and it'll all work out in the end. Start local, start small, reach out to local meetup organizers and make a name for yourself in your community. It can sometimes be difficult, but networking and just talking shop at local events pays off in ways that are not always immediately evident. The person you're talking to might be asked for a reference when conference organizers are making selections. That person may put you in touch with people who run a conference they're familiar with. The phrase is cliche and vapid, but it is truly not always _what_ you know, but *who* you know.

With that caveat in mind, you (typically!) must submit a CFP in order to be accepted to a conference. Laying the groundwork by being active in the community is a great start, but it can only get you so far. To succeed in being accepted by a conference, you should attempt to bring something new to the scene--or talk about something interesting--and this can be most adequately conveyed in a CFP (*C*all *F*or *P*roposal). Let's talk about how to craft one, and what it is.

## Call for Proposals

A call for proposal is typically a one-pager abstract of the high level goals of your talk. Some technical detail can and probably should be provided, but you're simply trying to convey to the organizers several things:

1. You know what you're talking about
1. The topic is interesting and non-trivial (i.e. bring something new to the space)
1. The abstract is well-written and free of gramatical errors
  - Treat it like a resume; have someone else look it over to validate simple typos that oftentimes go overlooked

If you can convey each of these separate concerns, and do so in clear, succinct language, you are well on your way to crafting a successful abstract.

For some examples of some CFPs I've written, I've "open sourced" them and made them [available on GitHub](https://github.com/dschau/CFPs/2017). Only the CSS in JS proposal was actually accepted, but I still think the other ones are interesting! Feel free to run with any of those as a starting basis for crafting your own CFP.

## Finding a Conference

As mentioned, starting local is oftentimes a great place to make a name for yourself and it can oftentimes be easier to speak at a conference in which you're a member of local meetups and other technical events.
