I graduated from Creighton University (also in Omaha) with a degree in Computer Science that I’ve translated into my current career as a front-end developer. My current employer is <a href="https://objectpartners.com/">Object Partners, Inc.</a>—an incredible IT consulting company headquartered in Minneapolis with smaller offices in Omaha, Milwaukee, and Chicago. I previously worked at <a href="https://up.com">Union Pacific</a>, where I worked on a team who development encapsulated components with AngularJS and Foundation.</p>\n<h3 id="technical-interests"><a href="#technical-interests" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Technical interests</h3>\n<p>I tend to skew quite heavily towards the front-end spectrum of development, and so I enjoy discussing/writing about JavaScript with a particular emphasis on frameworks and new technologies for development. You can regularly find me messing around with some new framework, implementing some new technology, or in general just tinkering and learning.</p>\n<h3 id="non-technical-interests"><a href="#non-technical-interests" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Non-technical interests</h3>\n<p>In my spare time, I enjoy golfing—although I am decidedly not that great with something like a 20+ handicap, going to movies, traveling and exploring the world, and mentoring, among many, many other interests!</p>\n<p>Now that we have that out of the way, I hope you enjoy your time here!
